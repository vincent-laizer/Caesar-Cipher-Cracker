## Caesar Cipher Cracker

The program prompts user to enter cipher text, ciphered using Caesar cipher algorithim, asked to choose between brute force or frequency analysis, the rest is upon the program. It will display the plain text and the key used during encryption.

The brute force option is not recommended since it will print the output of all keys that have been tried and its upon the user to look for the text that makes sense.
